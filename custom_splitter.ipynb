We have with us Ms. Avantika Krishna - Chief Sales Officer of the Company and Mr.\\nNiraj Kumar Ganeriwal – CFO and COO of the Company. Mr. Aditya Krishna will not be able\\nto join due to some personal emergency.\\nNow I will hand over the call to Ms. Avantika for her opening remarks. Thank you.\\nAvantika Krishna: Thank you, Vinay. Hello, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our earnings call to discuss\\nthe performance of the 4th Quarter and Financial Year 2025.\\nLet me start off by briefing you on the key business highlights of the 4th Quarter and full year\\nended 2024-25, after which my colleague Niraj – COO and CFO, will brief you on the financials.\\nAs you all might be aware, the IT sector has been facing several headwinds globally. Despite\\nthese, I am pleased to say that we managed to report a good performance during the periods\\nunder review.\\nDuring Financial Year \\'25, we made significant strides by making strategic investments in\\nbuilding AI frameworks and accelerators that help our clients accelerate innovation, enhance\\nengineering productivity and confidently scale their AI initiatives. Our AI accelerators, including\\nSakPilot, Quality360, SolidHub, and Sakcelerate, these accelerators enable transformation for\\nour customers by providing a strong foundation for automation, agility, and intelligent\\noperations across the software product engineering lifecycle.\\nParallelly, we accelerated our go-to-market initiatives by onboarding high-caliber sales talent\\nand expanding our client-partner network. These efforts have been aimed at deepening customer\\nrelationships, improving market coverage, and driving sustainable growth. We are beginning to\\nsee early traction from these initiatives.\\nA notable highlight of the year was the addition of a new client in the banking and financial\\nservices vertical, contributing an annual contract value of approximately USD 0.5 million. This\\nPage 2 of 13\\nSaksoft Limited\\nMay 27, 2025\\nwin not only validates our focused approach to high-growth verticals, but also demonstrates the\\ngrowing relevance of our digital solutions.\\nOn the financial front, the Board has recommended a final dividend of INR 0.40 per share, 40%\\nof face value of INR 1, bringing the total dividend for Financial Year \\'25 to INR 0.80 per share,\\n80% of face value, in line with our commitment to delivering shareholder value.\\nNow I would request my colleague Niraj to give you the financial highlights for the quarter\\nunder review.\\nNiraj Kumar Ganeriwal: Thank you, Avantika. And thank you, everyone, for taking the time and joining our earnings call\\ntoday to discuss the results of the 4th Quarter of the Financial Year 2025 under review.\\nFor the 4th Quarter of the Financial Year 2025, revenues were reported at approximately INR\\n240 crores, reflecting a robust year-on-year growth of 23.1%. The operating EBITDA for the\\nquarter stood at INR 36 crores, which is 9.3% increase year-on-year with the EBITDA margins\\nat 15.17%. The net profit for the quarter was around INR 30 crores, which grew 29.4% year-on-\\nyear and 11.1% quarter-on-quarter with the profit after tax margins being at 12.52%.\\nFor the full Financial Year 2025, the revenues were reported at INR 883 crores. This represents\\na growth of around 15.9% year-on-year. The operating EBITDA for the year stood at INR 146\\ncrores, which grew by 7% year-on-year and the EBITDA margins for the year were at 16.56%.\\nThe net profit was at around INR 109 crores, which grew year-on-year by 13.1% with the PAT\\nmargins being at 12.32%.\\nNow coming to revenue split by geography for the current year. The Americas contributed to\\n42% of our total revenues, whereas Europe contributed 23% and the remaining 35% came from\\nAsia Pacific and other regions. The on-site revenue continues to be at 45% and offshore at 55%\\nof our total revenues.\\nThe revenue split across verticals for the Financial Year 2025 are as follows: BFS contributed\\nto about 30% of our revenues, emerging verticals around 46%, logistics 13%, and commerce\\ncontributed to about 11%.\\nComing to some of our customer metrics, Saksoft has around 15 customers of USD $1 million\\nplus revenues. The total employee count at the end of the quarter stood at 2,618. Out of which,\\n2,373 were technical, with the utilization level of the employees excluding trainees, being at\\n85% for the Financial Year 2025.\\nThat concludes the updates on the quarter. And we can now open the floor for the Q&A session.\\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question is\\nfrom the line of Vinay Menon from Monarch Networth Capital Limited. Please go ahead.\\nPage 3 of 13\\nSaksoft Limited\\nMay 27, 2025\\nVinay Menon: Hi, sir, congratulations on a very good set of numbers. So, just one thing, sir. We have now\\nmentioned this emerging vertical in this quarter, and we have changed the segmental data a bit.\\nSo, can you give me some clarity? Because we did not mention this as a vertical in the earlier\\nquarters. So, what has changed as such?\\nAvantika Krishna: Hi, Vinay. So, nothing has really changed with regards to the segments. The focus is still the\\nsame. We have just renamed them. And so Emerging Verticals originally was Hitech, Media and\\nTelecommunications or Hitech, Media, Utilities, HMU.\\nVinay Menon: Great. That is helpful. And in terms of growth guidance, any guidance over \\'26? Because we are\\nseeing some relief from tariff issues and all. So, any kind of guidance you can give for \\'26?\\nNiraj Kumar Ganeriwal: So, Vinay, it\\'s really difficult to give guidance, but obviously we have targets. And the objective\\nfor the current year for the management team is at least to do a growth which we have done in\\nthe previous year and might be try and do better. But at a high level, we are looking at a range\\nof Rs. 1,000 crores to Rs. 1,100 crores for the Financial Year \\'26.\\nVinay Menon: That really helps. And in terms of verticals, what verticals will be leading this? Like what could\\nbe the main drivers from vertical side?\\nNiraj Kumar Ganeriwal: In terms of verticals, I think one of the focus areas, whilst Avantika did mention that the\\nEmerging Verticals is more of a rebranding for Hitech, Media and Utilities. I think that is a\\nvertical where we will see a lot of traction, growth and progress. That is also primarily because\\nof the recent investments which we have done.\\nIf you note the acquisitions which we have done on the Salesforce and on the ServiceNow area,\\nwhich is around intelligent products, we do believe that a lot of work in these areas will be on\\nthe new age verticals and that\\'s a vertical where we might see some significant growth in the\\ncoming year. Duly supported by BFS, but I think BFS and Emerging Verticals should see a\\nbetter growth.\\nVinay Menon: Thank you for that clarity, sir. I will join the queue.\\nModerator: Next question is from the line of Vikas Srivastava from RBC Financial. Please go ahead.\\nVikas Srivastava: Good afternoon. You know what I am hearing on the call, the first question is this, that we are\\nstill growing in the range of 16%. A couple of years back, we had made a mission statement of\\n$500 million by 31st March 2030, if I remember, which would require us to compound at about\\n26%, 27%, 20%, somewhere in that range percent CAGR per year to get there. We have done\\nabout $100 million this year, the last financial year.\\nSo, what are we looking at? Is that vision? Is that target? Is that goal still in sight? Or is it\\nsomething which we are not reaffirming now? And even with your current target of Rs. 1,000\\ncrores to Rs. 1,100 crores, which you are talking about, we are still looking at 10% to 15%\\nPage 4 of 13\\nSaksoft Limited\\nMay 27, 2025\\ngrowth per year, which is nowhere close to what our vision statement was, if I may call it a target\\nor a vision statement.\\nAnd the other thing was that, you know, that was the first question. Second question was that\\nyour stock option, which you allotted to your employees for the last two years, most of it would\\nstill be probably a little under water. How do you find stock options and retention of senior\\nmanagement as an instrument of compensation paying out when, at least optically right now, the\\nstock options are not accretive to employee compensation for the last two years?\\nAvantika Krishna: So Vikas, I will try and answer the first question and then I will hand it over to Niraj to answer\\nyour second. The first question on your vision statement of 500 million by 2030, as a Company,\\nwe are confident that we are still going to make that vision that we promised.\\nYes, we have, as you know, that there are headwinds in the U.S. And that\\'s why the guidance\\nthat Niraj has given is a basis that as we don\\'t know what will happen in the U.S., Trump keeps\\nchanging his mind every day. So, we are all uncertain.\\nBut I think the last one year we have really focused on our positioning. And so we have invested\\na lot of time in our AI accelerators, like I mentioned, but we have also invested a lot on the\\nplatform side. And that is what we are seeing over the next two years, we will definitely build\\nour pipeline.\\nSo, yes, we are being a bit conservative on the guidance, but that\\'s due to the headwinds that we\\nare seeing. And I think from a confidence level, we are seeing pipeline build. And as of now, no\\nnegative impact.\\nNiraj Kumar Ganeriwal: Coming to your second part of the question, because on the ESOP options, you have rightly\\npointed out that most of them would be under the water. But I think that\\'s the nature of this\\ncompensation criteria. The Management Team and the senior people are very, very committed.\\nAnd other than a couple of them, the key management team and number of them have been with\\nthe Company for 10 plus years. So, they have seen cycles, and I think it\\'s only a temporary cycle.\\nThe team is committed and all of us are working towards that goal of US$500 million. And\\neveryone knows that as we move forward and we are inching closer to those targets, these\\noptions will give the return which they expect. So, it is definitely not a deterrent. In fact, any\\nnew senior hire we look at, they are in fact more keen to get options because this is still\\nconsidered one of the most rewarding mechanisms.\\nVikas Srivastava: So, if I may just repeat what you said that we are still in the next five financial years at an average\\nCAGR of anywhere between 25% to 30% is not off the table. It\\'s still a distinctly clear possibility\\nor a goal which the management is aimed at. That is one take away from me.\\nThe second question was, what are we talking about in terms of EBITDA margins etc. You\\nknow, we have been investing in sales and platforms for a while now. We were, if I remember\\nPage 5 of 13\\nSaksoft Limited\\nMay 27, 2025\\nright, and I could be wrong at the time, said that we should be looking at about 18% in this\\ncompetitive market. So, are we still saying that? Is there pressure on margins? Will the market\\nbecome more competitive? Or do we need to pass on more? Those were the two questions which\\nI had.\\nNiraj Kumar Ganeriwal: So, the first one, yes, just to affirm what Avantika had said and your statement that yes, we are\\nstill looking at the 500 million, the CAGR still is expected at 25%-30%, CAGR being CAGR,\\nso one year could be lower, other year could be higher. But as a team, we are all still focusing\\non that number. It\\'s not a moving target. And we are constantly looking at how we can achieve\\nthe 500 million.\\nOn the second point, EBITDA, yes, 18%. In fact, in the current year itself, you would have seen'"

Let me start off by briefing you on the key business highlights of the 4th Quarter and full year ended 2024-25, after which my colleague Niraj – COO and CFO, will brief you on the financials. As you all might be aware, the IT sector has been facing several headwinds globally. Despite these, I am pleased to say that we managed to report a good performance during the periods under review. During Financial Year '25, we made significant strides by making strategic investments in building AI frameworks and accelerators that help our clients accelerate innovation, enhance engineering productivity and confidently scale their AI initiatives. Our AI accelerators, including SakPilot, Quality360, SolidHub, and Sakcelerate, these accelerators enable transformation for our customers by providing a strong foundation for automation, agility, and intelligent operations across the software product engineering lifecycle. Parallelly, we accelerated our go-to-market initiatives by onboarding high-caliber sales talent and expanding our client-partner network. These efforts have been aimed at deepening customer relationships, improving market coverage, and driving sustainable growth. We are beginning to see early traction from these initiatives. A notable highlight of the year was the addition of a new client in the banking and financial services vertical, contributing an annual contract value of approximately USD 0.5 million. This Page 2 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 win not only validates our focused approach to high-growth verticals, but also demonstrates the growing relevance of our digital solutions. On the financial front, the Board has recommended a final dividend of INR 0.40 per share, 40% of face value of INR 1, bringing the total dividend for Financial Year '25 to INR 0.80 per share, 80% of face value, in line with our commitment to delivering shareholder value. Now I would request my colleague Niraj to give you the financial highlights for the quarter under review. Thank you, Avantika. And thank you, everyone, for taking the time and joining our earnings call today to discuss the results of the 4th Quarter of the Financial Year 2025 under review. For the 4th Quarter of the Financial Year 2025, revenues were reported at approximately INR 240 crores, reflecting a robust year-on-year growth of 23.1%. The operating EBITDA for the quarter stood at INR 36 crores, which is 9.3% increase year-on-year with the EBITDA margins at 15.17%. The net profit for the quarter was around INR 30 crores, which grew 29.4% year-on- year and 11.1% quarter-on-quarter with the profit after tax margins being at 12.52%. For the full Financial Year 2025, the revenues were reported at INR 883 crores. This represents a growth of around 15.9% year-on-year. The operating EBITDA for the year stood at INR 146 crores, which grew by 7% year-on-year and the EBITDA margins for the year were at 16.56%. The net profit was at around INR 109 crores, which grew year-on-year by 13.1% with the PAT margins being at 12.32%. Now coming to revenue split by geography for the current year. The Americas contributed to 42% of our total revenues, whereas Europe contributed 23% and the remaining 35% came from Asia Pacific and other regions. The on-site revenue continues to be at 45% and offshore at 55% of our total revenues. The revenue split across verticals for the Financial Year 2025 are as follows: BFS contributed to about 30% of our revenues, emerging verticals around 46%, logistics 13%, and commerce contributed to about 11%. Coming to some of our customer metrics, Saksoft has around 15 customers of USD $1 million plus revenues. The total employee count at the end of the quarter stood at 2,618. Out of which, 2,373 were technical, with the utilization level of the employees excluding trainees, being at 85% for the Financial Year 2025. That concludes the updates on the quarter. And we can now open the floor for the Q&A session.\"},\n",

       "   'question_text': 'Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question is from the line of Vinay Menon from Monarch Networth Capital Limited. Please go ahead. Page 3 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 mentioned this emerging vertical in this quarter, and we have changed the segmental data a bit. So, can you give me some clarity? Because we did not mention this as a vertical in the earlier quarters. So, what has changed as such?',\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Avantika Krishna, Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"Hi, Vinay. So, nothing has really changed with regards to the segments. The focus is still the same. We have just renamed them. And so Emerging Verticals originally was Hitech, Media and Telecommunications or Hitech, Media, Utilities, HMU. seeing some relief from tariff issues and all. So, any kind of guidance you can give for '26? So, Vinay, it's really difficult to give guidance, but obviously we have targets. And the objective for the current year for the management team is at least to do a growth which we have done in the previous year and might be try and do better. But at a high level, we are looking at a range of Rs. 1,000 crores to Rs. 1,100 crores for the Financial Year '26. be the main drivers from vertical side? In terms of verticals, I think one of the focus areas, whilst Avantika did mention that the Emerging Verticals is more of a rebranding for Hitech, Media and Utilities. I think that is a vertical where we will see a lot of traction, growth and progress. That is also primarily because of the recent investments which we have done. If you note the acquisitions which we have done on the Salesforce and on the ServiceNow area, which is around intelligent products, we do believe that a lot of work in these areas will be on the new age verticals and that's a vertical where we might see some significant growth in the coming year. Duly supported by BFS, but I think BFS and Emerging Verticals should see a better growth.\"},\n",

       "  {'question_speaker': 'Vikas Srivastava',\n",
       "   'question_text': 'Good afternoon. You know what I am hearing on the call, the first question is this, that we are still growing in the range of 16%. A couple of years back, we had made a mission statement of $500 million by 31st March 2030, if I remember, which would require us to compound at about 26%, 27%, 20%, somewhere in that range percent CAGR per year to get there. We have done about $100 million this year, the last financial year. So, what are we looking at? Is that vision? Is that target? Is that goal still in sight? Or is it something which we are not reaffirming now? And even with your current target of Rs. 1,000 crores to Rs. 1,100 crores, which you are talking about, we are still looking at 10% to 15% Page 4 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 growth per year, which is nowhere close to what our vision statement was, if I may call it a target or a vision statement. And the other thing was that, you know, that was the first question. Second question was that your stock option, which you allotted to your employees for the last two years, most of it would still be probably a little under water. How do you find stock options and retention of senior management as an instrument of compensation paying out when, at least optically right now, the stock options are not accretive to employee compensation for the last two years?',\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Avantika Krishna, Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"So Vikas, I will try and answer the first question and then I will hand it over to Niraj to answer your second. The first question on your vision statement of 500 million by 2030, as a Company, we are confident that we are still going to make that vision that we promised. Yes, we have, as you know, that there are headwinds in the U.S. And that's why the guidance that Niraj has given is a basis that as we don't know what will happen in the U.S., Trump keeps changing his mind every day. So, we are all uncertain. But I think the last one year we have really focused on our positioning. And so we have invested a lot of time in our AI accelerators, like I mentioned, but we have also invested a lot on the platform side. And that is what we are seeing over the next two years, we will definitely build our pipeline. So, yes, we are being a bit conservative on the guidance, but that's due to the headwinds that we are seeing. And I think from a confidence level, we are seeing pipeline build. And as of now, no negative impact. Coming to your second part of the question, because on the ESOP options, you have rightly pointed out that most of them would be under the water. But I think that's the nature of this compensation criteria. The Management Team and the senior people are very, very committed. And other than a couple of them, the key management team and number of them have been with the Company for 10 plus years. So, they have seen cycles, and I think it's only a temporary cycle. The team is committed and all of us are working towards that goal of US$500 million. And everyone knows that as we move forward and we are inching closer to those targets, these options will give the return which they expect. So, it is definitely not a deterrent. In fact, any new senior hire we look at, they are in fact more keen to get options because this is still considered one of the most rewarding mechanisms.\"},\n",
       "  {'question_speaker': 'Vikas Srivastava',\n",
       "   'question_text': \"So, if I may just repeat what you said that we are still in the next five financial years at an average CAGR of anywhere between 25% to 30% is not off the table. It's still a distinctly clear possibility or a goal which the management is aimed at. That is one take away from me. The second question was, what are we talking about in terms of EBITDA margins etc. You know, we have been investing in sales and platforms for a while now. We were, if I remember Page 5 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 right, and I could be wrong at the time, said that we should be looking at about 18% in this competitive market. So, are we still saying that? Is there pressure on margins? Will the market become more competitive? Or do we need to pass on more? Those were the two questions which I had.\",\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"So, the first one, yes, just to affirm what Avantika had said and your statement that yes, we are still looking at the 500 million, the CAGR still is expected at 25%-30%, CAGR being CAGR, so one year could be lower, other year could be higher. But as a team, we are all still focusing on that number. It's not a moving target. And we are constantly looking at how we can achieve the 500 million. On the second point, EBITDA, yes, 18%. In fact, in the current year itself, you would have seen it’s slightly come down. We are closer to 16.5%. Whilst we are growing and reinvesting, there will be a short-term drop. That's mainly because of the hiring of the salespeople, investment in accelerators, investment in the center of excellence capabilities which we are building up. But those are maybe a year or year-and-a-half phenomenon. And once they start kicking into results, it should go back to 17% to 18%. But, rightly said, for the current year, we were at around 16% plus. And for the coming year, we could be only on a similar range, if not higher.\"},\n",

Has it been carried forward from the 2% FPI shareholding? Has it been carried forward from previous years?',\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",
       "   'answer_text': 'They have been there. So, the FPIs have been in and out, and their shareholding has been continuous. It may not be the same. It may be some of them would have come, some of them would have gone. But the shareholding of FPI, FII has been around this percentage of slightly higher in the last 24-36 months.'},\n",

       "   'question_text': 'And in terms of our sales team, we are doing a lot of hiring in the last two years. In terms of any attrition, have we lost people? And that was one question. And another question was on we have done a lot of small acquisitions. Are we now talking about more acquisitions in the pipeline in the near future or are we talking about organic growth? Is the emphasis more on organic growth now to meet our targets of turnover?',\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Avantika Krishna, Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"So, on the sales side, we are constantly investing in the sales team and more importantly sales team on the ground in the U.S. But we are turning around quite quickly. So, if the performance is not good from these resources, we take decisions fast and we replace. So, our churn rate is good, and we will act fast when we need to. In terms of acquisition, Vikas, whilst we have done a good set of acquisitions, have acquired a lot of capability, and the focus will be on the organic, but historically, we have seen that the growth has come both from organic and inorganic. And if there is something which we come across as a good asset, we will be happy to acquire. But currently, the focus is more on the Page 6 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 organic side, especially with the intelligent platforms, the Salesforce, the ServiceNow capabilities which we have acquired. I think that's going to be one of the push factors in the current year for us.\"},\n",

       "   'answer_speaker': 'Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",

And by the 90th day, the teams are integrated, the sales team, delivery team, support team. So, I think whatever we have acquired is fully integrated. In fact, the good thing is some of the growth which has come in this quarter is also as a result of the capability which these acquisitions have brought in, taking them to the existing set of customers. So, it's been a good integration which we feel, and it's going in the right direction.\"},\n",

So, I just wanted to sort of, I am sorry, new to the Company. So, my question was on your aspiration to be a $0.5 billion sales Company, top line Company by FY '30. So, sir and ma’am, given this is a very crowded space in terms of IT services, so what gives us that edge? What is the niche that we are sort of focusing on? I am sorry, I am new to your Company. So, maybe this question is very basic, but just wanted to get your perspective on what are the white spaces or what are the gaps or areas that you are going after where you have seen that this opportunity to scale up from $100 million to $500 million.\",\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Avantika Krishna',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"Sure, Rohit. So, as you are new to the Company, I will give you a little bit of history. You know, we have traditionally been focusing on domain-specific technology solutions. And the domains that we focused on were a small handset of them, like one was banking and financial, the second is Hitech, Media and Utilities, the third is logistics, and the fourth is commerce. And the last, I would say, five to six years, we were focusing on these four mainly and really building our solutions that are catered to these industries in specific. Very recently, maybe the end of last year, we engaged a small consultancy firm and felt it was a need to transform in this very evolving industry that we are in. And AI being the front of everything, we felt it was important to also transform. Otherwise, we won't be relevant tomorrow. Page 7 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 So, last year we spent a lot of time, like I mentioned, we spent a lot of time and investment in AI frameworks and also AI platforms. And we have now focused our capabilities on intelligent products and intelligent platforms. So, what we mean by intelligent products is helping customers in their entire product engineering life cycle or software development life cycle, right from building new products to enhancing existing products or even sustaining these products. And how can we leverage AI in all these three initiatives. And the second area is intelligent platforms, where we have chosen five platforms that we want to invest in. And the acquisitions last year added two of those five. And these five are including Salesforce, ServiceNow, Databricks, Snowflake and HCL Commerce. And we are just sort of helping customers modernize, implement, customize, help them sort of optimize in these platforms. And so these are the areas that we are trying to create a niche for ourselves in a crowded market. Yes, you are right, it is crowded. And so we see ourselves also competing with the larger players, Tier-1, Tier-2 players. But I think because of our size, we are known to be flexible. Our turnaround time is quick and our customers like us for quick turnaround time and our agility. So, that's how we are creating a differentiation in the market.\"},\n",

So, I just want to get more clarity on when we say intelligent products, so does it mean that are we collaborating with these Page 8 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 products like those companies who are manufacturing these products like Microsoft? So, when we say intelligent products, which are our clients in this case?\",\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Avantika Krishna',\n",
       "   'answer_text': 'So, when we say intelligent products, it is independent software vendors that we are referring to, that will be our customers. And these ISVs, we call them, is selling products to the market. So, for example, a large ISV would be Salesforce or ServiceNow. Those would be enterprise ISVs. So, intelligent products are two ISVs in space. Did I answer your question? Because the line was a little unclear. So, I am just wondering if I answered the question right.'},\n",

So, Avantika, once more, recently one of the peer companies has highlighted a major loss, one of their vendors in this case, because of that, because of the AI has become a big disruptor and the contract value has drastically come down. So, are we seeing that threat? Because as I said, again, there are a lot of disruptors which are happening. So, how are we preparing ourselves? Because that can hit us as well.

We feel it as more of an opportunity because we can actually go into a new customer where they have another vendor working for them and we can disrupt that space by offering them lower costs or in terms of improved efficiencies over time.

       "   'answer_text': \"Maybe for a year or two, Amit, I would say that it would be a new normal because like I have said five years back when we were about $50 million and when we moved up to $100 million of revenues, we were about 12%-13% of margins which went up to 17% to 18%. So, the costs do come in early, but they don't stay along too long when the results start kicking. But I think for the next 12 to 18 months, it would be realistic to say that this is the new normal.

It's also because of the texture of revenues, if you see that the contribution from the Asia Pacific and other regions is almost 35% plus. So, the payment terms in most of the APAC is anywhere between 60 to 90 days, whereas in the U.S. geography, it is 30 to 60 days.

Let me start off by briefing you on the key business highlights of the 4th Quarter and full year ended 2024-25, after which my colleague Niraj – COO and CFO, will brief you on the financials. As you all might be aware, the IT sector has been facing several headwinds globally. Despite these, I am pleased to say that we managed to report a good performance during the periods under review. During Financial Year '25, we made significant strides by making strategic investments in building AI frameworks and accelerators that help our clients accelerate innovation, enhance engineering productivity and confidently scale their AI initiatives. Our AI accelerators, including SakPilot, Quality360, SolidHub, and Sakcelerate, these accelerators enable transformation for our customers by providing a strong foundation for automation, agility, and intelligent operations across the software product engineering lifecycle. Parallelly, we accelerated our go-to-market initiatives by onboarding high-caliber sales talent and expanding our client-partner network. These efforts have been aimed at deepening customer relationships, improving market coverage, and driving sustainable growth. We are beginning to see early traction from these initiatives. A notable highlight of the year was the addition of a new client in the banking and financial services vertical, contributing an annual contract value of approximately USD 0.5 million. This Page 2 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 win not only validates our focused approach to high-growth verticals, but also demonstrates the growing relevance of our digital solutions. On the financial front, the Board has recommended a final dividend of INR 0.40 per share, 40% of face value of INR 1, bringing the total dividend for Financial Year '25 to INR 0.80 per share, 80% of face value, in line with our commitment to delivering shareholder value. Now I would request my colleague Niraj to give you the financial highlights for the quarter under review. Thank you, Avantika. And thank you, everyone, for taking the time and joining our earnings call today to discuss the results of the 4th Quarter of the Financial Year 2025 under review. For the 4th Quarter of the Financial Year 2025, revenues were reported at approximately INR 240 crores, reflecting a robust year-on-year growth of 23.1%. The operating EBITDA for the quarter stood at INR 36 crores, which is 9.3% increase year-on-year with the EBITDA margins at 15.17%. The net profit for the quarter was around INR 30 crores, which grew 29.4% year-on- year and 11.1% quarter-on-quarter with the profit after tax margins being at 12.52%. For the full Financial Year 2025, the revenues were reported at INR 883 crores. This represents a growth of around 15.9% year-on-year. The operating EBITDA for the year stood at INR 146 crores, which grew by 7% year-on-year and the EBITDA margins for the year were at 16.56%. The net profit was at around INR 109 crores, which grew year-on-year by 13.1% with the PAT margins being at 12.32%. Now coming to revenue split by geography for the current year. The Americas contributed to 42% of our total revenues, whereas Europe contributed 23% and the remaining 35% came from Asia Pacific and other regions. The on-site revenue continues to be at 45% and offshore at 55% of our total revenues. The revenue split across verticals for the Financial Year 2025 are as follows: BFS contributed to about 30% of our revenues, emerging verticals around 46%, logistics 13%, and commerce contributed to about 11%. Coming to some of our customer metrics, Saksoft has around 15 customers of USD $1 million plus revenues. The total employee count at the end of the quarter stood at 2,618. Out of which, 2,373 were technical, with the utilization level of the employees excluding trainees, being at 85% for the Financial Year 2025. That concludes the updates on the quarter.

And so Emerging Verticals originally was Hitech, Media and Telecommunications or Hitech, Media, Utilities, HMU. seeing some relief from tariff issues and all. So, any kind of guidance you can give for '26? So, Vinay, it's really difficult to give guidance, but obviously we have targets. And the objective for the current year for the management team is at least to do a growth which we have done in the previous year and might be try and do better. But at a high level, we are looking at a range of Rs. 1,000 crores to Rs. 1,100 crores for the Financial Year '26. be the main drivers from vertical side? In terms of verticals, I think one of the focus areas, whilst Avantika did mention that the Emerging Verticals is more of a rebranding for Hitech, Media and Utilities. I think that is a vertical where we will see a lot of traction, growth and progress. That is also primarily because of the recent investments which we have done. If you note the acquisitions which we have done on the Salesforce and on the ServiceNow area, which is around intelligent products, we do believe that a lot of work in these areas will be on the new age verticals and that's a vertical where we might see some significant growth in the coming year. Duly supported by BFS, but I think BFS and Emerging Verticals should see a better growth.\"},\n",

       "   'question_text': 'Good afternoon. You know what I am hearing on the call, the first question is this, that we are still growing in the range of 16%. A couple of years back, we had made a mission statement of $500 million by 31st March 2030, if I remember, which would require us to compound at about 26%, 27%, 20%, somewhere in that range percent CAGR per year to get there. We have done about $100 million this year, the last financial year. So, what are we looking at? Is that vision? Is that target? Is that goal still in sight? Or is it something which we are not reaffirming now? And even with your current target of Rs. 1,000 crores to Rs. 1,100 crores, which you are talking about, we are still looking at 10% to 15% Page 4 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 growth per year, which is nowhere close to what our vision statement was, if I may call it a target or a vision statement. And the other thing was that, you know, that was the first question. Second question was that your stock option, which you allotted to your employees for the last two years, most of it would still be probably a little under water. How do you find stock options and retention of senior management as an instrument of compensation paying out when, at least optically right now, the stock options are not accretive to employee compensation for the last two years?',\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Avantika Krishna, Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"So Vikas, I will try and answer the first question and then I will hand it over to Niraj to answer your second. The first question on your vision statement of 500 million by 2030, as a Company, we are confident that we are still going to make that vision that we promised. Yes, we have, as you know, that there are headwinds in the U.S. And that's why the guidance that Niraj has given is a basis that as we don't know what will happen in the U.S., Trump keeps changing his mind every day. So, we are all uncertain. But I think the last one year we have really focused on our positioning. And so we have invested a lot of time in our AI accelerators, like I mentioned, but we have also invested a lot on the platform side. And that is what we are seeing over the next two years, we will definitely build our pipeline. So, yes, we are being a bit conservative on the guidance, but that's due to the headwinds that we are seeing. And I think from a confidence level, we are seeing pipeline build. And as of now, no negative impact. Coming to your second part of the question, because on the ESOP options, you have rightly pointed out that most of them would be under the water. But I think that's the nature of this compensation criteria. The Management Team and the senior people are very, very committed. And other than a couple of them, the key management team and number of them have been with the Company for 10 plus years. So, they have seen cycles, and I think it's only a temporary cycle. The team is committed and all of us are working towards that goal of US$500 million. And everyone knows that as we move forward and we are inching closer to those targets, these options will give the return which they expect. So, it is definitely not a deterrent. In fact, any new senior hire we look at, they are in fact more keen to get options because this is still considered one of the most rewarding mechanisms.\"},\n",
       "  {'question_speaker': 'Vikas Srivastava',\n",
       "   'question_text': \"So, if I may just repeat what you said that we are still in the next five financial years at an average CAGR of anywhere between 25% to 30% is not off the table. It's still a distinctly clear possibility or a goal which the management is aimed at. That is one take away from me. The second question was, what are we talking about in terms of EBITDA margins etc. You know, we have been investing in sales and platforms for a while now. We were, if I remember Page 5 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 right, and I could be wrong at the time, said that we should be looking at about 18% in this competitive market. So, are we still saying that? Is there pressure on margins? Will the market become more competitive? Or do we need to pass on more? Those were the two questions which I had.\",\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Niraj Kumar Ganeriwal',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"So, the first one, yes, just to affirm what Avantika had said and your statement that yes, we are still looking at the 500 million, the CAGR still is expected at 25%-30%, CAGR being CAGR, so one year could be lower, other year could be higher. But as a team, we are all still focusing on that number. It's not a moving target. And we are constantly looking at how we can achieve the 500 million. On the second point, EBITDA, yes, 18%. In fact, in the current year itself, you would have seen it’s slightly come down. We are closer to 16.5%. Whilst we are growing and reinvesting, there will be a short-term drop. That's mainly because of the hiring of the salespeople, investment in accelerators, investment in the center of excellence capabilities which we are building up. But those are maybe a year or year-and-a-half phenomenon. And once they start kicking into results, it should go back to 17% to 18%. But, rightly said, for the current year, we were at around 16% plus. And for the coming year, we could be only on a similar range, if not higher.\"},\n",

In terms of acquisition, Vikas, whilst we have done a good set of acquisitions, have acquired a lot of capability, and the focus will be on the organic, but historically, we have seen that the growth has come both from organic and inorganic. And if there is something which we come across as a good asset, we will be happy to acquire. But currently, the focus is more on the Page 6 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 organic side, especially with the intelligent platforms, the Salesforce, the ServiceNow capabilities which we have acquired.

So, I just wanted to sort of, I am sorry, new to the Company. So, my question was on your aspiration to be a $0.5 billion sales Company, top line Company by FY '30. So, sir and ma’am, given this is a very crowded space in terms of IT services, so what gives us that edge? What is the niche that we are sort of focusing on? I am sorry, I am new to your Company. So, maybe this question is very basic, but just wanted to get your perspective on what are the white spaces or what are the gaps or areas that you are going after where you have seen that this opportunity to scale up from $100 million to $500 million.\",\n",
       "   'answer_speaker': 'Avantika Krishna',\n",
       "   'answer_text': \"Sure, Rohit. So, as you are new to the Company, I will give you a little bit of history. You know, we have traditionally been focusing on domain-specific technology solutions. And the domains that we focused on were a small handset of them, like one was banking and financial, the second is Hitech, Media and Utilities, the third is logistics, and the fourth is commerce. And the last, I would say, five to six years, we were focusing on these four mainly and really building our solutions that are catered to these industries in specific. Very recently, maybe the end of last year, we engaged a small consultancy firm and felt it was a need to transform in this very evolving industry that we are in. And AI being the front of everything, we felt it was important to also transform. Otherwise, we won't be relevant tomorrow. Page 7 of 13 Saksoft Limited May 27, 2025 So, last year we spent a lot of time, like I mentioned, we spent a lot of time and investment in AI frameworks and also AI platforms. And we have now focused our capabilities on intelligent products and intelligent platforms. So, what we mean by intelligent products is helping customers in their entire product engineering life cycle or software development life cycle, right from building new products to enhancing existing products or even sustaining these products. And how can we leverage AI in all these three initiatives. And the second area is intelligent platforms, where we have chosen five platforms that we want to invest in. And the acquisitions last year added two of those five. And these five are including Salesforce, ServiceNow, Databricks, Snowflake and HCL Commerce. And we are just sort of helping customers modernize, implement, customize, help them sort of optimize in these platforms. And so these are the areas that we are trying to create a niche for ourselves in a crowded market. Yes, you are right, it is crowded. And so we see ourselves also competing with the larger players, Tier-1, Tier-2 players. But I think because of our size, we are known to be flexible. Our turnaround time is quick and our customers like us for quick turnaround time and our agility. So, that's how we are creating a differentiation in the market.\"},\n",

Because these are some of we have partnered with some of the tools and licenses like HCL, the Salesforce, the Business Objects. And when there is a sale of these which happen to the customers, these are predominantly in relation to third-party licenses which are bought and sold. So, the regrouping has been done in the right line today. Earlier it used to be a very insignificant component. But since the amount was slightly higher this year, it has been regrouped.
